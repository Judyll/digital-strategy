With respect to the hypothetical situation, as a test, produce a simple proof of concept 3-tier architecture which exposes a REST service that allows a user to store player names and cumulative points for each player. There needs to be an endpoint that can add names, and an endpoint that can increment the points total for a player by a specific amount defined in the url parameter, and which also returns the newest value.

Only do it so long as it will not be a major inconvenience for you. It's your choice, but no promises and no hard feelings. You may do everything right with respect to this problem and still not be selected. I just don't want you to feel let down and as though you wasted your time. Good luck either way! :)
